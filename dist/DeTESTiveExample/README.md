# DeTESTive Example

An example of how to use DeTESTive.

## Installation

Note: You do not need to install DeTESTive for this plugin to work.

If you are not using r2modman or Thunderstore for installation, follow these steps:

1. Download BepInEx (build artifact 667 or higher) from the official repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files into the same folder as the "Shadows of Doubt.exe" executable.
3. Launch the game, load the main menu, and then exit the game.
4. Download the DeTESTive mod from the Releases page. Unzip the files and place them in corresponding directories within "Shadows of Doubt\BepInEx...".
5. Start the game.
6. To see how the mod works across multiple save files, save a game from within Shadows of Doubt and name it "Example Save". If you skip this step, some tests will fail, showing that DeTESTive can detect and work around missing save files.
