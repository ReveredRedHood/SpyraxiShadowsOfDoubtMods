# Hours Of Operation - Shows the operating hours for businesses on their door

A BepInEx Bleeding Edge (v667) plugin for Shadows of Doubt.

## What is it?

This plugin will cause a message to show up with a company's operating hours when you try to enter the main entrance of a business while it's locked.

## Installation

### r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager installation

If you are using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/oneapp/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) for installation, simply download the mod from the Online tab.

### Manual installation

Follow these steps:

1. Download BepInEx (build artifact 667 or higher) from the official repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files into the same folder as the "Shadows of Doubt.exe" executable.
3. Launch the game, load the main menu, and then exit the game.
4. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Releases page. Unzip the files and place them in corresponding directories within "Shadows of Doubt\BepInEx...". Also, download the [SOD.Common](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/Venomaus/SODCommon/) dependency.
5. Start the game.
